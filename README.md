# DARK-20 v0.0.3

> "Dogecoin is infinite. Kabosu is not."

**Dark-20** is a behavioral art piece and a digital monument. It rejects the infinite inflation of Dogecoin by creating a thermodynamic "Black Hole" — a cryptographically derived, unspendable address where value engages in the purest form of consensus: Loss.

## The Protocol

This is a single-page digital experience designed to facilitate the voluntary burning of Dogecoin as a form of respect.

- **Status**: Active / Immutable
- **Version**: v0.0.3 (Caching + Reduced Motion + Robust Polling)
- **Roadmap**: NONE.
- **Token Sale**: NEVER.
- **Profit**: 0.

### The Black Hole
**Address:** `DDogepartyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxw1dfzr`

This is the historic "Dogeparty" burn address.
