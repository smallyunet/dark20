# DARK-20

> "Dogecoin is infinite. Kabosu is not."

**Dark-20** is a behavioral art piece and a digital monument. It rejects the infinite inflation of Dogecoin by creating a thermodynamic "Black Hole" — a cryptographically derived, unspendable address where value engages in the purest form of consensus: Loss.

## The Protocol

This is a single-page digital experience designed to facilitate the voluntary burning of Dogecoin as a form of respect.
